    DENTAL IMPLANT
Ceramco Dental Clinic has been successfully doing Dental Implant Treatments for more than 22 years.

Dental implants are commonly considered restorations that are used to replace missing teeth. A Dental Implant is an artificial tooth placed into the jaw to hold a replacement tooth or bridge. Titanium  and its alloys have become the metals of choice for dental implants. It is extremely safe and Bio-compatible (not harmful or toxic to living tissue).

Dental implants are a great option for people who have lost a tooth or teeth due to periodontal (gum)disease, an injury or some other reason. There are a number of benefits to choosing Dental implants as opposed to other types of dental restorations such as-

Improved appearance. Dental implants look and feel  just like natural teeth and  because they are designed to fuse with bone, they become permanent. You would not even notice the difference between your original teeth and the Implants.

Improved speech. With poor-fitting dentures, the teeth can slip within the mouth causing you to mumble or slur your words. Dental implants allow you to speak without  a worry and improves your self confidence.

Easier eating. Sliding dentures can make chewing difficult. Dental implants function like your own teeth, allowing you to eat your favorite foods with confidence and without pain.

Basal implants 



Basal Implants are the most advanced implants, successful for any condition of bone. It can be used on patients with any bone density and any bone volume. These implants are loaded in the hard portion of the bone in the mouth (i.e the highly dense cortical bone). Basal-bone is present in everyone, despite severe bone loss due to gum disease or loss of teeth. As such, they are highly recommended for patients who are in need of bone grafts and sinus lift. This protocol can be performed in controlled diabetic patients, smokers and patients with severe gum disease with equal success.

Permanent-fixed teeth in  5 days is the in thing in Basal dental implant treatment today at Ceramco Dental Clinic.

As the name suggests, every patient receives fixed permanent ceramic teeth within 5 days from the day of implant placement. The most conservative surgical technique combined with an in-house dental laboratory can deliver fixed teeth in a single day at Ceramco Dental Clinic.

With Permanent fixed teeth in 5 days protocol we can replace a single tooth, several teeth, or a full mouth of teeth, upper or lower, with remarkable comfort, predictability and aesthetics.

The Permanent-fixed teeth-in-5 days protocol is performed in a single phase.

It includes,

– Any tooth extraction, as indicated

– Implant placement, as planned

– Custom made CAD-CAM (designed ‘n’ milled) permanent prosthesis (teeth) fixed on Implants.

On the first visit, the implant team at Ceramco Dental Clinic clinically examines the patient, followed by necessary X-rays taken for preliminary assessment. A 3D CBCT if required will be performed for precision planning. A virtual placement of implants will be demonstrated to the patient on the 3D CBCT SCAN on a CCPL Software which is our USP here at Ceramco Dental Clinic, where all the treatments are explained in detail through beautiful animations which make it interesting and easily understood by patients of all ages.
