 They say a dentist is an artist but being a pediatric dentist adds a little more sparkle to it.



Pediatric dentistry recommends that a child visit the dentist by the age of 1 or within 6 months after the first tooth erupts. Many people don’t realize how important their child’s baby teeth are to lifelong oral health. It is very important to keep baby teeth in place until they are lost naturally for the following reasons,

Helping children chew properly to maintain good nutrition
Involvement in speech development
Helping save space for permanent teeth and guiding them into the correct position
Promoting a healthy smile that helps children feel good
Permitting normal development of the jaw bones and muscles.
What is the best way to prepare your child for the whirring machinery sharp instruments and a stranger telling them to “open wide”?

Give you child a sneak preview, have your child accompany you while you are having your dental treatment or check ups done. So that they can see first hand what a trip to the dentist clinic entails.

It is best if you refrain from using words around your child that might cause unnecessary fear, such as needle, pull, drill or hurt. Ceramco Dental Clinic makes a practice of using words that convey the same message but are pleasant and non-frightening to the child. We will record the child’s dental and medical history, complete a comprehensive examination, and discuss any findings with you.

Brushing not only twice but in the correct manner is of utmost importance in children, parental guidance is important to ensure correct methods to brushing. In order to make it fun it should be a family activity.

Cavities can be fought off before they happen. Fluoride in right amounts at the right age can work wonders in protecting your child’s teeth against cavities. Neglected cavities can and frequently do lead to problems which affect developing permanent teeth.

Our little ones require extreme care and caution while treating their milk teeth. The materials used in children’s treatments are very different from the ones used for adults.

A child has 20 milk teeth. All milk teeth fall at particular age

Front lower will fall at 6 to 8 years of age
Front upper will fall at 7 to 9 years of age.
Upper and lower back teeth will fall from age 11 years to 14 years
The first permanent molars teeth come without any teeth falling at the age of 6 years. So caring for them is very important. Ceramco Dental Clinic advises sealants which help to prevent cavities in permanent teeth and make them easy to clean.

Developing malocclusions, or bad bites, can be recognized as early as 2-3 years of age. Often, early steps can be taken to reduce the need for major orthodontic treatment at a later age. We at Ceramco Dental Clinic partner with you to decide what treatment is best for your child and value your opinion about any treatment option–for regular checkups, fillings, sedations or baby tooth root canals. We use the newest procedures and techniques to ensure our little ones safety and comfort.
