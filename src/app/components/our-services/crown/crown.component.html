Dentistry is an art as well as a science. Dental crowns offer a perfect example of this.
<br><br>
A dental crown or “cap” is a covering that fits over a damaged, decayed or unattractive tooth. It can even replace a tooth entirely as part of dental bridgework.
<br><br>
Your dentist may recommend a crown to : <br><br>
<ul *ngFor="let lineitem of lineitems">
  <li>{{lineitem}}</li>
</ul>

Crowns strengthen damaged teeth, allowing them to function normally again. When crafted from today’s high-tech porcelains (dental ceramics), crowns are virtually indistinguishable from natural teeth. They can even bedesigned to improve upon a tooth’s original appearance. Other possibilities include porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns (PFM), which have a metal interior for strength and a porcelain exterior for a more natural appearance, and all-porcelain crowns with Zirconia, representing the strongest ceramic crowns.
