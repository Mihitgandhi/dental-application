    BRIDGES
Bridges are commonly used to replace one or more missing teeth and they span the space where the teeth are missing.

bridgesThey are cemented to the natural teeth or implants surrounding the empty space.

What Are the Benefits of Dental Bridges?
Bridges can:

Restore your smile
Restore the ability to properly chew and speak
Maintain the shape of your face
Distribute the forces in your bite properly by replacing missing teeth
Prevent remaining teeth from drifting out of position.
There are multiple types of dental bridges available at Ceramco Dental Clinic. Our prosthodontist will make the necessary evaluation before he recommends what type of dental bridge is suited for your need.

Here are the following types of bridges.
Traditional
This consists of a false tooth thatâ€™s anchored by dental crowns and are attached to the surrounding teeth. It is commonly applied when you still have healthy natural teeth on both sides of your missing tooth.

Cantilever
This type of bridge is similar to a traditional porcelain dental bridge. However, instead of needing two neighboring teeth, this only needs one to hold it in place.

Maryland
A Maryland dental pontic will not need a dental crown to be attached to the surrounding teeth. Instead, it uses a metal or a porcelain framework to position it as a replacement of your missing tooth.

 Implant-supported dental bridge
A dental implant is a dental screw which replaces the roots of your natural teeth. The implant will be used as an anchor for the dental bridge, making the crown and bridge stable and durable.
